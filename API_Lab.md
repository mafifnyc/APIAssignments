# API Lab

## Overview
Let's Work With Postman and learn API. Postman is REST API Client. We will use this tool to learn more about API, Create API calls and validate the API responses manually and programmatically.

1. Use this document to [Send your first request](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/) using postman.
    *  Can you tell us in your own word what just happened after making your first request?
2. [Create your first collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), Collection Name: api-lab
    * Save your request from step 1 in  collection.
    * Save all your request in this collection
3. Building a request requires many components. Please read every paragraph in this document and learn every component by implementing in your postman. [Building  Requests](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/requests/).
   This task will take sometime. Once you are done with this rest of the task will be very easy. Fasten Your Seat Belt and Keep moving. Enjoy the ride and joy of doing practical things!!!
